A simple app, built in Swift, showing CPU percentage, country flag (based on the user's public IP), and battery time remaining in the menu bar.

## Install

1. Download the dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Thinkr1/Menubar-Info/releases)
2. As I don't have a paid developer account, I cannot direcly notarize the app and you'll be presented with an alert saying it cannot be opened directly. Here are two options:

a) You can run the following command and then open the app normally: 

```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app/folder/Menubar-Info.app
```

b) You can allow the app to be opened in *System Settings > Privacy & Security* by clicking "Open Anyway" for Rregex.app:

<sub>CPU percentage is obtained by using the command `ps -A -o %cpu | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'`</sub>


<sub>IP location is obtained by using the command `curl -s ip-api.com/json/$(curl -s ifconfig.me) | jq -r '.query + " " + .countryCode'` (and IP (v4) is obtained with `curl -s ifconfig.me`)</sub>

<sub>Battery percentage is obtained with `pmset -g batt | awk '/[0-9]+%/ {gsub(/;/, "", $3); print $3}'` and time remaining is obtained with `pmset -g batt | awk '/[0-9]+:[0-9]+/ {print $5}'`</sub>
